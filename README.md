# Levin

Levin finds `<link rel="stylesheet">` and `<script src="...">` tags and replaces
them with their file contents.

This is useful when you have a very small site and two extra requests doesn't
worth the trouble.

## Roadmap to v0.1.0

- [ ] Find `link` and `script` tags
- [ ] Find the tags contents
- [ ] Replace the tags contents
- [ ] Add a CLI

## Roadmap for the future

- [ ] Add an option to look up for minified/unminified files
- [ ] Fetch remote files
- [ ] Batch process HTML files
